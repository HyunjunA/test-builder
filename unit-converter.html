        <h2>How Unit Conversion Works</h2>
        <p>Unit conversion is the process of changing a measurement from one unit to another within the same category. For most unit types, conversion works by establishing a base unit and defining conversion factors relative to that base. For example, in the Length category, the meter serves as the base unit. To convert from kilometers to inches, the converter first translates kilometers into meters and then meters into inches, ensuring accuracy through a standardized two-step process.</p>
        <p>Temperature is a special case because it requires formulas rather than simple multiplication. The Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin scales have different starting points (zero values) and different interval sizes. Converting between them requires specific mathematical formulas. For instance, to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit, you multiply by 9/5 and add 32. To convert Celsius to Kelvin, you add 273.15. These formulas ensure accurate conversions that account for the fundamental differences between temperature scales.</p>
        <p>Our converter uses the base-unit approach for all non-temperature categories. Each unit has a defined factor relative to the base. When you enter a value, the tool multiplies by the source factor to get the base value, then divides by the target factor to get the converted result. This approach guarantees consistency and precision across all conversions, making the tool reliable for both everyday and professional use.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="content-section">
        <h2>Common Conversion Factors</h2>
        <p>Understanding some common conversion factors can be helpful in daily life. One mile equals approximately 1.609 kilometers, or 5,280 feet. One kilogram equals about 2.205 pounds. One liter is equivalent to approximately 0.264 US gallons. One acre contains 43,560 square feet or about 4,047 square meters.</p>
        <p>In the world of data storage, conversions follow a base-1024 system (binary). One kilobyte (KB) equals 1,024 bytes, one megabyte (MB) equals 1,024 kilobytes, one gigabyte (GB) equals 1,024 megabytes, and one terabyte (TB) equals 1,024 gigabytes. Understanding these relationships is increasingly important in our digital age, whether you are managing storage on your phone, purchasing a hard drive, or evaluating internet data plans.</p>
        <p>For speed, knowing that one meter per second equals 3.6 kilometers per hour, and one mile per hour equals approximately 1.609 kilometers per hour, can be useful when comparing speed limits or athletic performance across different measurement systems. Similarly, one knot (nautical mile per hour) equals approximately 1.852 kilometers per hour, which is commonly used in maritime and aviation contexts.</p>

        <h2>History of Measurement Systems</h2>
        <p>The history of measurement systems stretches back thousands of years. Ancient civilizations developed their own units based on body parts, natural phenomena, and practical needs. The cubit, based on the length of the forearm, was used by the Egyptians to build the pyramids. The Romans introduced the mile (mille passus, meaning a thousand paces), and many of their measurements influenced European systems for centuries.</p>
        <p>The metric system was developed in France during the late 18th century as part of the French Revolution's push for rational, standardized measurements. Adopted officially in 1799, it was designed around powers of ten for easy calculation. Over the following two centuries, the metric system evolved into the International System of Units (SI), which is now used by virtually every country in the world for scientific and most commercial purposes.</p>
        <p>The imperial system, used primarily in the United States, has roots in the English system of weights and measures. It was standardized in the British Weights and Measures Act of 1824 and retains units such as feet, pounds, and gallons. While the UK has largely transitioned to metric, the US continues to use imperial units for everyday measurements, making unit conversion tools essential for international communication, trade, science, and travel.</p>
        <p>Today, the need for unit conversion arises constantly in global commerce, scientific research, engineering, cooking, travel, and countless other activities. Whether you are a student solving physics problems, a traveler comparing temperatures abroad, or an engineer working with international specifications, having a reliable and fast unit conversion tool is indispensable. Our converter is designed to meet all of these needs with a clean, intuitive interface and comprehensive category coverage.</p>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <details>
          <summary>How do I convert between metric and imperial units?</summary>
          <div class="faq-answer">Select the appropriate category (e.g., Length or Weight), choose the source unit and target unit from the dropdown menus, enter your value in the input field, and the converted result appears automatically in real time.</div>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>How does temperature conversion work?</summary>
          <div class="faq-answer">Temperature conversion uses specific formulas rather than simple multiplication factors. Celsius to Fahrenheit is (C x 9/5) + 32. Fahrenheit to Celsius is (F - 32) x 5/9. Celsius to Kelvin is C + 273.15. The converter handles these formulas automatically.</div>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>What unit categories are supported?</summary>
          <div class="faq-answer">The converter supports eight categories: Length (mm, cm, m, km, inch, foot, yard, mile), Weight (mg, g, kg, lb, oz, ton), Temperature (C, F, K), Volume (ml, L, gallon, quart, cup, fl oz), Area (sq m, sq km, sq ft, acre, hectare), Speed (m/s, km/h, mph, knots), Time (sec, min, hour, day, week, month, year), and Data (B, KB, MB, GB, TB).</div>
